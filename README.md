# Rbasecode
Base code in R using linear regression

R is a programming language and environment used for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and visualization.

R is popular among data scientists, statisticians, and researchers because it has a vast collection of libraries and packages for various applications. These packages provide tools for data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration. R can also interface with databases, spreadsheets, and other statistical software.

R has a command-line interface, but it also has integrated development environments (IDEs) such as RStudio, which provide a more user-friendly interface. R is open-source software, which means that it is free to use, and users can contribute to the development of the language and its packages.
This code adds several additional components to the previous code, including time-series analysis with ARIMA, classification with k-NN, clustering with k-means, visualization with PCA, and saving the final dataset with all the variables and predictions to a CSV file. These techniques are commonly used in econometrics to analyze and understand complex relationships between variables.
