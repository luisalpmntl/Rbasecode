# Rbasecode
Base code in R using linear regression

R is a programming language and environment used for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and visualization.

R is popular among data scientists, statisticians, and researchers because it has a vast collection of libraries and packages for various applications. These packages provide tools for data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration. R can also interface with databases, spreadsheets, and other statistical software.

R has a command-line interface, but it also has integrated development environments (IDEs) such as RStudio, which provide a more user-friendly interface. R is open-source software, which means that it is free to use, and users can contribute to the development of the language and its packages.
This code adds several additional components to the previous code, including time-series analysis with ARIMA, classification with k-NN, clustering with k-means, visualization with PCA, and saving the final dataset with all the variables and predictions to a CSV file. These techniques are commonly used in econometrics to analyze and understand complex relationships between variables.

This code is for data analysis and visualization in R programming language. Here is what the code does step by step:

It loads several libraries including tidyverse, car, lmtest, stargazer, zoo, ggplot2, nnet, and cluster.

It imports a dataset from a CSV file named "mydata.csv".

It performs a summary and a head of the dataset to explore its contents.

It checks for missing values in the dataset.

It renames the columns of the dataset to improve clarity.

It creates scatterplots to visualize the data.

It creates a multiple regression model using the lm() function.

It prints the summary of the model.

It tests for heteroscedasticity using the bptest() function.

It checks for multicollinearity using the vif() function.

It checks for normality of residuals using the shapiro.test() function.

It plots the residuals to check for normality and homoscedasticity.

It extracts the coefficients of the model.

It calculates the R-squared value of the model.

It performs hypothesis tests on the coefficients using the linearHypothesis() function.

It formats and prints the model output using the stargazer() function.

It performs nonlinear modeling with neural networks using the nnet() function.

It predicts the dependent variable using the neural network model.

It calculates the root mean squared error.

It plots the actual and predicted values.

It performs time-series analysis with ARIMA.

It creates a time-series object.

It plots the time-series data.

It decomposes the time-series data into its components.

It plots the decomposed time-series data.

It fits an ARIMA model to the time-series data.

It prints the ARIMA model summary.

It forecasts the dependent variable using the ARIMA model.

It plots the forecasted values.

It performs classification with k-NN.

It creates a new column in the dataset for the class variable.

It splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

It fits a k-NN model to the training data.
